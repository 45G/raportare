% Occasionally you may find that another package defines \cleardoublepage when it
% is not required. This may cause an unwanted blank page to appear before each
% glossary. This can be fixed by redefining \glsclearpage:
% http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/packages/glossaries/glossaries-manual.html
\renewcommand*{\glsclearpage}{\clearpage}
